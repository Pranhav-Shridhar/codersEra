// What according to you are the primitive data types in JavaScript?


// A primitive is a simple data type that is not made out of some other data types. It can only show you a single value. Every primitive is considered built-in data type by requirement, (the compiler has to be aware about them), yet not all built-in data types are called primitives. There are 5 types of primitive data that are available in JavaScript. They are boolean, undefined, null, number, and string are available. Everything else apart from this is an object only.
