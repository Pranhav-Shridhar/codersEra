// What do you mean by Escape Characters?


// Escape characters also known as backlash is mainly used when you are working with some special characters like double quotes, single quotes, ampersands, and apostrophes. Just place backslash before the characters to make it show.

// Example:

var a = "I m a "good" boy."

var b = "I m a \"good\" boy."
