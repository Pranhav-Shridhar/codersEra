// Explain the function “use strict”.


// “Use Strict” is a JavaScript directive that was launched in Es5. The main purpose of using this directive is to enforce the code is performed in strict mode. In this mode, we cannot use a variable without proclaiming it. This directive is ignored by the previous versions of JavaScript.
