// Explain what is hoisting in Javascript


// Hoisting is the concept in which Javascript, by default, moves all declarations to the top of the current scope. As such, a variable can be used before it has been declared.

// Note that Javascript only hoists declarations and not initializations.

console.log(a);

var a = 1;
