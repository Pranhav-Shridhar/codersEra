// Tell the way to import all the exports of a file as an object.


// Import* as object name from ‘./file.js’ is basically used to import all exported members as an object. You can just access all the exported variables or methods using dot (.) operator of the object.

import * from './random.js';

// Example:
// objectname.member1;
// objectname.member2;
// objectname.memberfunc();
