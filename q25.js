// What is the role of closures in JavaScript?


// The script builds a closure in JavaScript at the time of making of a function. It is a local variable that is present in the memory even after the function finishes its execution. Besides, it has a great access to the variable in three scopes: variable in its scope, global variables, and variables in the enclosing functionâ€™s scope. However, closures are tough in JavaScript to make sure the variable privacy, that is, to build private variables. Since JavaScript has no modifiers for access, closures permit the programmer to make variables that are not directly accessible.
