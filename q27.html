<!-- // Explain the procedure of document loading.


// Loading a document tells preparing it for further execution on the system. The document loads instantly on the browser when there is a running document on the system. The application (browser) permits the JavaScript engine to do dual tasks:

// Search for all the properties, provided to the object.
// Involve all the property values, used in the content that is being served for the page about to load.
// To load the document instantly, it is a great practice to add the <script> tag inside the <body> tag. The below program loads the document automatically and returns the OS details of the user: -->

<html>
  <body>
    <h1>JavaScript used</h1>

    <script>
      // <!-- Comments to hide js in old browsers
      document.write("Give the version: " + navigator.appVersion);
      document.write(" of <b>" + navigator.appName + "</b>.");
      // end of the comment section -->
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
