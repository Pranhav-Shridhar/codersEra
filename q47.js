// What is the difference between null, undefined, or undeclared JavaScript variable?


// Null is a value that you can assign to a particular object or variable. Undefined refers to a variable that has been proclaimed but no value is yet assigned to it. This specific type of variable is declared itself to be undefined. Undeclared refers to the variable that has been declared without any datatype. These all are primitive data types whereas Undeclared is not considered a primitive data type.

//null
var a = null;

//undefined
var b;

//undeclared
c;
var d;

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
